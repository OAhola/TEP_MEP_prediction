# Predictive modeling of TMS-evoked responses: unraveling instantaneous excitability states

![Project Logo](project_logo_teps.png)

## 📝 Description
This repository contains code for feature-based prediction of single-trial TMS-evoked TEP and MEP amplitudes. It also contains scripts for pre-processing TMS–EEG/EMG and MRI data, distributed source space modeling, average- and single-trial TEP amplitude extraction, and feature extraction from source-level parcels.
